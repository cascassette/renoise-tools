Renoise Tools by Cas
====================

This project consists of a handful of tools to make operating music making software [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com) easier - and in many cases that means more keyboard oriented. Description of any of these is also available on my [web page](http://www.cascassette.nl/software/renoise/).

All of the code in this repository is released under [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html); you are especially encouraged to (re)use it and learn from it.
