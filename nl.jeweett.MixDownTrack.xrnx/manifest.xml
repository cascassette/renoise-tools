  <Description>This tool has several options to create a 'sub-master' track in the mixer. Having this approach has several advantages:
      * Do mid-side processing, multiband compressing, etc. directly in the same renoise song file as the composition
      * No need for a 'clean out' send track whilst designing sounds (e.g. comparing fx with no proper dry/wet mixing)
      * Rendering patterns will render them how you hear them
      * "Force" option will make sure every track gets routed to the MixDown track and even adjust the send amount values along with the post-vol faders
